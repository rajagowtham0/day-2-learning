Day 3 learning of ftech vs pull, merge

Git pull
git pull is used to fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into the current local branch.
It works by first downloading updates (git fetch) and then applying them to the working branch through a merge operation.
git pull helps keep the local repository up to date with changes made by other collaborators on GitHub.
