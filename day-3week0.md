Git pull
git pull is used to fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into the current local branch.
It works by first downloading updates (git fetch) and then applying them to the working branch through a merge operation.
git pull helps keep the local repository up to date with changes made by other collaborators on GitHub.

git fetch 
git fetch is used to download the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them into the local branch.
It works by updating the remote-tracking branches, allowing users to review changes safely before applying them.
git fetch is useful when you want to inspect or compare updates from GitHub without affecting your current work.
